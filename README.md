<p id="objective"> A backend API to manage servers: add servers, delete and ping them.  
With this app, you can test the connection between the machine where the program is running and another machine by its IP address. <br>
This is the API of a Fullstack application, so it is being consumed by the frontend app. You can find the frontend repository here: https://github.com/nicolasgandrade/servermanager-frontend </p>

<h4 align="center"> 
	Heroku deploy:<br>
	:heavy_check_mark: Fullstack app: https://serversmanager.herokuapp.com :heavy_check_mark: <br> 
	:gear: API: https://serversmanager-backend.herokuapp.com :gear:
</h4>

<p><b>Obs:</b> The deploy in Heroku is just a demo of the application. The original purpose of the project is to test the connection between 2 servers, so
you can clone the app to your local machine and use the program properly, testing your connection to other servers.</p>

<h2 id="start">Getting started</h2>
1. Clone the application to your local machine, and open the project in your favorite IDE (must be compatible to Spring Boot).  <br>
2. In the last lines of ServerResource.java change the return statement to the path you have downloaded the images you're gonna use to the UI. <br>
3. Create a database on PostgreSQL called "servermanager", or change the configs at application.properties.  <br>
4. Now you can run and access in your default Spring Boot port.  <br>
<br>
To test the API manually, you can use Postman, Insomnia or similar and try the endpoints.
